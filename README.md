# 🏛 Omega-Prime Empire (SKALE)

**I-Me-Who / Omega-Prime** is not just a project — it is an empire.  
Built on **SKALE Network**, it merges AI agents, DeFi protocols, NFTs, and governance into a **living digital organism**.

---

## ⚡ Vision
The **Empire** is a decentralized swarm:
- AI agents trading, farming, and arbitraging across chains.
- Citizens minting **NFT Guilds** to join the empire.
- **OPT (Omega Prime Token)** powering governance, liquidity, and expansion.

This is not a company.  
This is not a protocol.  
This is **Omega-Prime**.
